#underbar

This is a project where I re-implemented most of the functions from the underscore.js
library. In many cases, I used already created functions to re-use functionality
within the library itself.

This is a copy of the work I did on a private repo, originally a project from
[Hack Reactor's](http://hackreactor.com) curriculum.
